## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some Favorite Applications:

- Google Sheets 
1. Holding down left click shows the addition of different cells
2. Doing cmd+clicking allow you to add the values of cells if they're not next to each other
3. You can add formulas to do all sort of different automations

- WhatsApp
1. Sending stickers is seamless and quick
2. Copying stickers are easy
3. You can change your text bubble color, as well as the background
4. Users have contact pictures they set themselves

- AMEX App
1. When you submit a payment, your balance updates immediately
2. The user interface is smooth and visually pleasing with the family of colors they used (mainly the dark blue colors)
3. There's no lag or latency when logging into the app

- Google Calendar
1. Being able to color code different events in the calendar helps a ton
2. Having 'tasks' you can complete is great -- it's like a checklist
3. Being able to automate events so you can set it then forget it
4. Having notifications for when something is coming up

App Idea:
I would like to build an app that tracks the user's spending. This could be done by connecting every credit or debit card the user has to the app. Then, it would see what category the user spent their money on, and would see the best CC (credit card) the user could have used. If the user uses the best one then they would be congratulated. They could see a history of all their purchases where they can click and see what card they used. They would be able to see more information such as the best possible CC for that purchase, differences in cashback/points, category, etc. There could be further optimizations by seeing what the user prefers -- this would be things like no yearly fee, points instead of cashback, etc. It would also give the user a score on how optimal their decisions are based on the current CCs they have at the moment. Some other things I would like on the app would be things like having dark and light mode, being able to tag purchases as the user pleases (e.g. gift, bill, fun), and having the app look like a 'game' -- kind of like how Robinhood looks like.

## Notes

I had trouble with these instructions: "Click on the Adjust Editor Options button on the top right of Xcode".
It was because that button doesn't exist on Xcode version 15/16.
Instead, I found out I had to go through Menu → Editor → Assistant
